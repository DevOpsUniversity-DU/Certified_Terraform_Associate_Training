## Steps to Follow
* Create an ec2 instance manually
* go to terraform server, create a folder
* create a file as below and edit all details of ec2 instance crated manually

## im.tf


provider "aws" {

  region = "us-east-1"
  
}


resource "aws_instance" "myserver" {

  ami                    = "ami-0747bdcabd34c712a"
  
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-1062c20d"]
  
  key_name               = "terra"
  
  subnet_id              = "subnet-f63bdbba"
  

  tags =  {
  
    Name = "tester"
    
  }
  
}


### terraform init, and run plan -- then it shows that it is going to add a new server

### Now, run the command : terraform import aws_instance.myserver i-05fb8e1ed2596e177 (<---- instanceid created)

### Now, if we do plan, it shows all upto date and from now on terraform tracks.
